        <h2>Synopsis</h2>

        <p>
            You think water moves fast? You should see. ice. It moves like it
            has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once and got a taste
            for murder. After the avalanche, it took us a week to climb out. Now
            Idon't know exactlv when we turned on each other. but I know that
            seven of us survived the slide... and only five made it out. Now we
            took an oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd sav it was the
            snow that killed the other two. but it wasn't. Nature is lethal but
            it doesn't hold a candle to man.
        </p>

        <p>
            Normally, both your asses would be dead as fucking fried chicken,
            but you happen to pull this shit while I'm in a transitional period
            so I don't wanna kill you, I wanna help you. But I can't give you
            this case, it don't belong to me. Besides, I've already been through
            too much shit this morning over this case to hand it over to your
            dumb ass.
